- **Mitigation:** Create prototype early, have fallback to static maps

### Data Risks
- **Risk:** Financial calculation errors
- **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive test suite with known examples

### Scope Risks
- **Risk:** Feature creep
- **Mitigation:** Stick to MVP first, track additional features for v2

### Performance Risks
- **Risk:** Large dataset performance
- **Mitigation:** Implement pagination, lazy loading, database indexing
